# Recipe Finder

## Capstone Project

## Introduction
This project is the culmination of all that we have learned while studying professional Software development with CodeClan. The main purpose of this app is to provide families with healthy recipes for meal planning as well as try to eliminate food waste by allowing the users to curate a shopping list of ingredients required to make each recipe from the application. The technologies used to build the application are as follows:

* Front-end - HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and React to create and update the user interface
* Back-end - Java, spring boot, H2 SQL (relational-database) to create the API and serve the data to the front end of the application.

## MVP
The main features of the application would alllow the users to:
* Allow users to view recipes with clear instructions and ingredients required to make each of the recipes.
* Users should be able to login to the application, implemented with OAuth2.
* Once logged in users should be able to save their favourite recipes and save the ingredients required to a shopping list.
* Users should then be able to delete the ingredient items they already have in stock.
* There should be functionality within the application to allow users to view a meal planner for each day of the week and save recipes to that day.

### Planning
Initial planning of the application was done by creating diagrams of wireframes and sitemaps to understand the architecture and components required to build the application. We also diagramed the relationship between the objects and relationships that would be needed to construct the dtatbase for the application.
